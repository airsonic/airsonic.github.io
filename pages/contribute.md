## How to contribute

Airsonic development is a community project, and contributions are welcomed.

##### Report bugs!

First see if your bug haven't been reported yet [here](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/issues).

If not get the information needed for a bug report and write us a new issue to our [github repository issue tracker](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/issues/new).

##### Contribute to the documentation!

The documentation is actually not really well documented, so any contributions is welcomed.

See our documentation [contributing guide](https://github.com/airsonic/documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

##### Submit a patch?!

If you want to code a little patch for use, you are pleased to do so !

See our [patch-welcome list](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apatches-welcome) on github.

##### Wanna ask, discuss about airsonic?

We have several places outside of github for community discussion, questions, etc:

- [#airsonic:matrix.org on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#airsonic:matrix.org)
- [#airsonic on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23airsonic)
- [airsonic subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/airsonic)

*Note that the Matrix room and IRC channel are bridged together.*

##### Translations

We provide a [platform](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/airsonic/develop/) to translate Airsonic in more than 25 languages.

Thanks to Weblate for hosting the translations platform !
